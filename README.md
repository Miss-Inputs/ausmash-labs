## Megan's Ausmash Labs

This is the source of, with all the Heroku thingoes to make it do something; in theory all that would be needed to run it yourself (if you for some reason wanted to do that) would have an environment variable API_KEY with your Ausmash API key (or you could hardcode it in ausmash_lib.py but that's probably a bad idea).

ausmash_lib.py contains the actual fun stuff, app.py contains the extremely lazy and quick and dirty Bottle web page in front of it.

Anyway, I don't know who would read this. It's just here. Enjoy.
